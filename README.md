# Hubble

Hubble is a Typescript implementation of a [Farcaster Hub](https://github.com/farcasterxyz/protocol#4-hubs).

## Getting Started

Hubble is organized as a monorepo with a stand-alone Hubble application, a library to interact with Hubble and shared utility packages.

- To run an instance of Hubble, follow the instructions in [@farcaster/hubble](/apps/hubble/README.md).
- To talk to a running Hubble server, follow the instructions in [@farcaster/js](/packages/js/README.md).
