# Replicator

A Node.js application that synchronizes a Farcaster Hub with a Postgres DB.

When the app is run, the replicator fetches historical data from the hub, which can take a few hours. Once backfilled, the replicator will then stream new events and messages into the database. The replicator will run fastest if the hub it communicates with is on the same private network (or same machine) as the replicator itself. If running the replicator and hub on the same machine, total sync time can be under 20 minutes with a modern laptop.

## Run locally

Sets up the Node.js application and Postgres DB locally using Docker containers. We recommend using this for quick experimentation.

### Requirements

Note: these are the bare minimum and are likely to increase as the network increases in size and activity.

* 2GB of memory
* 4GB of free disk space

### Instructions

#### Automatic Boostrap Script

1. Run: `curl -sSL https://download.farcaster.xyz/bootstrap-replicator.sh | bash`
2. Answer the prompts.

#### Running Manually

1. Copy .env.sample into .env in this folder
2. Run: `docker compose up -d`

Once the Docker images have finished downloading, you should start to see messages like:

```
[13:24:18.141] INFO (73940): Backfill 13.42% complete. Estimated time remaining: 46 minutes, 41 seconds
[13:24:23.228] INFO (73940): Backfill 13.52% complete. Estimated time remaining: 46 minutes, 50 seconds
[13:24:28.389] INFO (73940): Backfill 13.60% complete. Estimated time remaining: 47 minutes, 3 seconds
[13:24:33.502] INFO (73940): Backfill 13.71% complete. Estimated time remaining: 47 minutes, 10 seconds
...
```

If you are connected to a hub over the internet (rather than on the same machine or private network) the increased latency will make this take longer, and you will likely need to wait some time before an estimation of the time remaining will appear. This is expected.

You may see messages out of orderâ€”this is fine. If messages like above are appearing, replication is working as expected.

Note that the number of messages in the Postgres table will **not** match the number in the hub, because the replicator doesn't backfill "Remove" messages (like `CastRemove` and `ReactionRemove`) since these technically indicate an absence of content, not the presence.

### Connecting to Postgres

While it will take a few hours to fully sync all data from the hub, you can start to query data right away.

Run:

```sh
cd ~/replicator
docker compose exec postgres psql -U replicator replicator
```

See [Examples of SQL queries](#examples-of-sql-queries) below.

### Cleanup

If you're done with and no longer need the data locally:

* Go to the install directory `~/replicator`
* Run `./replicator.sh down`

## Examples of SQL queries

Once some data is populated, you can start to query it using SQL. Here are some examples:

Get the 10 most recent casts for a user:
```sql
select timestamp, text, mentions, mentions_positions, embeds from casts where fid = 2 order by timestamp desc limit 10;
```

Get the number of likes for a user's last 20 casts:
```sql
select timestamp, (select count(*) from reactions where type = 1 and target_cast_hash = casts.hash and target_cast_fid = casts.fid) from casts where fid = 3 order by timestamp desc limit 20;
```

Get the top-20 most recasted casts:
```sql
select c.hash, count(*) as recast_count from casts as c join reactions as r on r.target_cast_hash = c.hash and r.target_cast_fid = c.fid where r.type = 2 group by c.hash order by recast_count desc limit 20;
```

See the list of tables below for the schema.

## Database Schema

The following tables are created in Postgres DB where data from the Hubs are stored:

### `chain_events`

All on-chain events received from the hub event stream are stored in this table. These events represent any on-chain action including registrations, transfers, signer additions/removals, storage rents, etc. Events are never deleted (i.e. this table is append-only).

Column Name | Data Type | Description

block_timestamp | `timestamp with time zone` | Timestamp of the block this event was emitted in UTC.
fid | `bigint` | FID of the user that signed the message.
chain_id | `bigint` | Chain ID.
block_number | `bigint` | Block number of the block this event was emitted.
transaction_index | `smallint` | Index of the transaction in the block.
log_index | `smallint` | Index of the log event in the block.

block_hash | `bytea` | Hash of the block where this event was emitted.
transaction_hash | `bytea` | Hash of the transaction triggering this event.
body | `json` | JSON representation of the chain event body (changes shape based on `type`).

### `username_proofs`

via the `deleted_at` column. When querying usernames, you probably want to query the `fnames` table directly, rather
than this table.
