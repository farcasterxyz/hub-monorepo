/**
 * A simple LRU cache implementation that uses a double-buffer to store the keys and values.
 *
 * The "current" buffer is used to store the most recently accessed keys and values. When the
 * "current" buffer is full, the existing "prev" buffer is dropped, (dropping the least used
 * keys), the current buffer is moved to the "prev" buffer and a new "current" buffer is created.
 *
 * The "get" method also accepts a function that will be called if the key is not found in the cache.
 *
 * If a key is not found in the current buffer, but it is in the "prev" buffer, it is moved to the
 * current buffer.
