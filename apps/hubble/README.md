# Hubble

**Hubble is a Typescript implementation of a Farcaster Hub**

Users can upload Farcaster Messages to Hubble, which stores and replicates them to other Hubs on the network. Hubble follows the Farcaster [protocol specification](https://github.com/farcasterxyz/protocol).

## Getting Started

### Starting Hubble locally

You'll need to [install dependencies](../../CONTRIBUTING.md#2-setting-up-your-development-environment) and have the RPC URL of an Ethereum Goerli node, which you can get [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/) or [Infura](https://www.infura.io/). Then:

1. Navigate to this folder from the root
2. `yarn identity create` to create a network identity for your Hub
3. `yarn start -e <eth-rpc-url>` to boot up the Hub, where `eth-rpc-url` points to the Goerli node's RPC

You should see messages indicating that the Hub is syncing with the blockchain, but it won't sync user messages yet. For that you'll have to restart the Hub with the address of at least one known peer using: `yarn start -e <node url> -b <peer address>`. When Hubs are live, the Farcaster team will update this to include the IP address of a boostrap hub.

### Deploying Hubble in the cloud

Hubble can be run on cloud servers with 2 vCPUs, 8 GiB RAM and 15 GiB of SSD storage. Follow these guides to get Hubble running on your preferred provider:

- [AWS EC2](https://warpcast.notion.site/Set-up-Hubble-on-EC2-Public-23b4e81d8f604ca9bf8b68f4bb086042)
- GCP (planned)
- Azure (planned)
- Digital Ocean (planned)

### Interacting with Hubble

Hubble exposes [gRPC](https://grpc.io/) API's and uses [Protobufs](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf) for data serialization. SDK's are available in multiple languages to interact with Hubble API's:

- [Javascript / Typescript](../../packages/js/)
- Golang (planned)

If an SDK is not available in your language, you can use the definitions in the [protobufs package](../../packages/protobufs/) to auto-generate bindings.

## Architecture

A Hub is a single-process daemon that receives data from clients, other hubs and farcaster contracts. It has three main components:

- [P2P Engine]() - establishes a gossipsub network to exchange messages with hubs.
- [Sync Engine]() - handles edge cases when gossip fails to deliver messages.
- [Storage Engine]() - checks message validity, persists them to disk and emits events.

### Storage Engine

Messages received by Hubble are forwarded to the Storage engine which forwards them to the appropriate CRDT Set. Once validated by the CRDT Set, messages are persisted to [RocksDB](https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb) and events are emitted to listeners.

```mermaid

subgraph Hubble
    subgraph Storage
        StorageEngine(Storage Engine) --> Sets
        Sets(CRDT Sets) <--> DB[(Rocks<br/>DB)]
    end
end
```

CRDT sets are implemented to meet the specification in the Farcaster protocol. The engine also tracks state of the Farcaster contracts, which are necessary for validating the Signer CRDT Set.

### P2P Engine

Hubble connects to other peers over a GossipSub network established using [LibP2P](https://github.com/libp2p/libp2p). Messages merged into the Storage Engine are immediately gossiped to all of is peers.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
subgraph Hubble

    subgraph Networking
        P2PEngine(P2PEngine) --> LibP2P(LibP2P)
    end
end
```

Hubble will only peer with trusted peers and employs a simple network topology during beta. It peers only with known instances which must be configured at startup. In later releases, the network topology will be modified to operate closer to a trustless mesh.

### Sync Engine

Hubble periodically performs a [diff sync](https://github.com/farcasterxyz/protocol#41-synchronization) with other peers to discover messages that may have been dropped during gossip. This is performed using gRPC APIs exposed by each Hub instance.

        SyncEngine(SyncEngine) --> RPC(RPC Client)
    end
end
```
