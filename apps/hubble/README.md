## What is Hubble?

Hubble is a Typescript implementation of a [Farcaster Hub](https://github.com/farcasterxyz/protocol).


A Hub will download an entire copy of the network to your machine and keep it in sync. Messages can be created and uploaded to a Hub and they will propagate to all other Hubs. Running a Hub gives you a private instance that you can query as much as you like and helps decentralize the network.
