# Hubs

A Hub is a node in the Farcaster network that stores a copy of all data.

Hubs accept messages from users and replicate them to each other in real-time in a peer-to-peer fashion. A Hub will store every active message on the network and can be used to submit new messages. Running a Hub is a great way to get permissionless access to data and to help with decentralizing the network.

## Requirements

A Hub can be run on any machine that has:

- A public IP address
- 8 GB of RAM
- 2 CPU cores or vCPUs
- 20 GB of free storage

The storage requirements will grow over time as more users join the network. At 10M daily active users we expect storage to approach 64TB.
