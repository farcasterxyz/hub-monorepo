// Implement this interface in your app to handle messages. The package currently provides the following gurantees:
// - Messages can be assumed to be processes in the same order as they were recieved by the hub as long as wasMissed in false
// - if wasMissed is true, then the package provides no guarantees about the ordering (it is possible to receive an add
//      after a remove, your app needs to handle the CRDT resolution). We will provide a way to handle this in the future.
// - If the same messages is received multiple times, isNew will be set to false for all but the first time
// - state is a user friendly translation of the impact of the message to the CRDT set (e.g. a "merge" of a remove message
// is semantically a delete of the existing add, and state will be set to "deleted" in that case)
