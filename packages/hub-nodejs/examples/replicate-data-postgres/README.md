# Replicate Hub data to Postgres

An example Node.js application that keeps a PostgresDB in sync with a Farcaster Hub. Sync is performed using a two-phase process:

1. A streaming process that will receive new messages from the Hub
2. A backfill process that will receive older messages from the Hub

When the app is run, both processes are kicked off to bring the database in sync. The streaming ensures that new messages are pushed to the DB. The backfill downloads older messages and can take 1 or more hours depending on your configuration. It is stateful and can be resumed safely without re-ingesting all the data.

## Run locally

Sets up the Node.js application and Postgres DB locally using docker containers. We recommend using this for quick experimentation.

### Requirements

* 1GB of memory
* 4GB of free disk space
* Docker. If you're running macOS, run `brew bundle && open -a Docker` from this directory, otherwise go [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

### Instructions

1. Clone the repo locally: `git clone git@github.com:farcasterxyz/hub-monorepo.git`
2. Navigate to this directory with `cd packages/hub-nodejs/examples/replicate-data-postgres`
3. Run `docker compose up`

Once the Docker images have finished downloading, you should start to see messages like:

```
replicate-data-postgres-app-1   | [04:46:13.051] INFO (61): [Backfill] Completed FID 1/12837. Estimated time remaining: 2h 6m 22.5s
replicate-data-postgres-app-1   | [04:46:13.053] INFO (61): [Backfill] Completed FID 5/12837. Estimated time remaining: 2h 33m 36.9s
replicate-data-postgres-app-1   | [04:46:13.767] INFO (61): [Backfill] Completed FID 6/12837. Estimated time remaining: 2h 33m 19.8s
replicate-data-postgres-app-1   | [04:46:14.636] INFO (61): [Backfill] Completed FID 7/12837. Estimated time remaining: 2h 41m 25.5s
...
replicate-data-postgres-app-1   | [04:56:50.142] INFO (86): [Sync] Processing merge event 304011714592768 from stream
replicate-data-postgres-app-1   | [04:56:50.142] INFO (86): [Sync] Processing merge event 304011726786560 from stream
...
```

You may see messages out of orderâ€”this is fine. If messages like above are appearing, replication is working as expected.

### Connecting to Postgres

While it will take a few hours to fully sync all data from the hub, you can start to query data right away.

Run:

```sh
docker compose exec postgres psql -U app hub
```

See [Examples of SQL queries](#examples-of-sql-queries) below.

### Cleanup

If you're done with the example and no longer need the data locally:

* Go to the example's directory (`cd packages/hub-nodejs/examples/replicate-data-postgres`)
* Run `docker compose down --rmi all -v`.

This will remove the Docker images, NPM packages, and Postgres data.

## Run on Render

Set up the Node.js application and Postgres DB in the cloud using [Render](https://render.com/). This will be slower than running locally.

### Requirements

* Register an account at Render and create a project.
* You'll need a subscription to pay for the **Standard** instance type for Postgres ($20/mth at time of writing).

### Instructions

1. Create a new **PostgreSQL** instance in your project. Select the **Standard** instance type (for the storage).
2. Create a new **Background Worker**, and connect a **Public Git repository** using the following URL: `https://github.com/farcasterxyz/hub-monorepo`
   * Select the `main` branch
   * Use the directory of this README for the **Root Directory** (`packages/hub-nodejs/examples/replicate-data-postgres`
   * Set `Node` as the **Runtime**
   * Set `yarn install` as the **Build Command**
   * Set `yarn start` as the **Start Command**
   * Select **Starter** for the instance type
   * Under the **Advanced** section:
      * Add a `POSTGRES_URL` environment variable, setting it to the **Internal Database URL** of the Postgres instance you created earlier.
      * Disable **Auto-Deploy**
   * Click **Create Background Worker**.

Go to the **Logs** tab and confirm the application is running.

```
[01:06:37.823] INFO (86): [Backfill] Starting FID 1/12830
[01:06:38.478] INFO (86): [Backfill] Completed FID 1/12830
[01:06:38.478] INFO (86): [Backfill] Starting FID 2/12830

[01:06:50.142] INFO (86): [Sync] Processing merge event 304011714592768 from stream
[01:06:50.142] INFO (86): [Sync] Processing merge event 304011726786560 from stream
...
```

If you see messages like the above, everything is working as expected.

### Connecting to Postgres

While it will take a few hours to fully sync all data from the hub, you can start to query data right away.

1. Go to the Postgres instance you created and select the **Shell** tab.
2. Within the shell, run `psql $POSTGRES_URL` to open a DB console session.

See [Examples of SQL queries](#examples-of-sql-queries) below.

### Cleanup

If you're done with the example and no longer need the data, you can delete the Background Worker and Postgres instances.

## Examples of SQL queries

Once some data is populated, you can start to query it using SQL. Here are some examples:

Get the 10 most recent casts for a user:
```sql
select timestamp, text, mentions, mentions_positions, embeds from casts where fid = 2 order by timestamp desc limit 10;
```

Get the number of likes for a user's last 20 casts:
```sql
select timestamp, (select count(*) from reactions where reaction_type = 1 and target_hash = casts.hash and target_fid = casts.fid) from casts where fid = 3 order by timestamp desc limit 20;
```

Get the top-20 most recasted casts:
```sql
select c.hash, count(*) as recast_count from casts as c join reactions as r on r.target_hash = c.hash and r.target_fid = c.fid where r.reaction_type = 2 group by c.hash order by recast_count desc limit 20;
```

See the list of tables below for the schema.
