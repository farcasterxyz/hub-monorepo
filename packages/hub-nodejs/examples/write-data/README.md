## Writing Data to Hubs

An example that writes different types of messages like casts, reactions, follows, etc. given a signer private key for an fid. 

The example runs on testnet by default so that you can make changes safely without affecting your mainnet data.

### Run on StackBlitz

We do not recommend running this example in a cloud environment because it requires your custody address.
