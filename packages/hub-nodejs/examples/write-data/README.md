## Setting Up An Account And Writing Data to Hubs

An example that signs up a new user on chain, purchases storage, creates a signer and updates the user's profile.

Given a custody address with ~10$ worth of funds on OP Mainnet, this example will:
 - Register an FID on the IdRegistry contract
 - Purchase 1 unit of storage on the StorageContract
 - Create a signer on the KeyRegistry contract
 - Register an fname on the fname registry server
 - Update the user's profile

### Run on StackBlitz

We do not recommend running this example in a cloud environment because it requires your custody address.
